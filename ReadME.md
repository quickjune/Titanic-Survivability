Here we have used Data science concepts in this project named as " TITANIC SURVIVABILITY OF PASSENGERS"

We all know what happened to titanic when it hit the iceberg.
And also we know the famous story of Jack and Rose.
We know that some of the people died when titanic drowned in atlantic ocean.
Here we will be calculating the accuracy of survivability of passengers from this data.

Note:- Pls import/downlaod all the neccesary packages before while crrating an environment.
In the project i have given the query to downlaod all the packages and create env. so have a look at the project carefully.
Select the environment is vs code on the top right.
 I have used anaconda and ran in the VS code IDE by installing important extensions like python, jupyter.
